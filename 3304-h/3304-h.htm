      ACT I
    </h2>
    <p>
      [JULIA PATTERSON'S apartments in a model tenement on the lower East Side.
      The scene shows the living-room, furnished very plainly, but in the newest
      taste; "arts and crafts" furniture, portraits of Morris and Ruskin on the
      walls; a centre table, a couple of easy-chairs, a divan and many
      book-shelves. The entrance from the outer hall is at centre; entrance to
      the other rooms right and left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [At rise: JULIA has pushed back the lamp from the table and is having a
      light supper, with a cup of tea; and at the same time trying to read a
      magazine, which obstinately refuses to remain open at the right place. She
      is an attractive and intelligent woman of thirty. The doorbell rings.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Ah, Jack! [Presses button, then goes to the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Enters, having come upstairs at a run. He is a college graduate and
      volunteer revolutionist, one of the organizers of the "Society of the
      Friends of Russian Freedom"; handsome and ardent, eager in manner, and a
      great talker.] Hello, Julia. All alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Yes. I expected a friend, but she can't come until later.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Just eating?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I've been on the go all day. Have something.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No; I had dinner. [As she starts to clear things away.] Don't stop
      on my account.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I was just finishing up. [As he begins to help.] No; sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Nonsense. Let the men be of some use in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. What have you been up to to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. We're organizing a demonstration for the Swedish strikers.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. It's marvelous how those Swedes hold on, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. The people are getting their eyes open. And when they're once open,
      they stay open.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Yes. Did you see my article?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I should think I did! Julia, that was a dandy!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Do you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I do, indeed. You've made a hit. I heard a dozen people talking
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. You've come to be the champion female muck-raker of the country, I
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      [JULIA laughs.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Why did you want to see me so specially tonight?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I've a friend I want you to meet. Somebody I'm engaged in
      educating.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. You seem to have chosen me for your favorite proselytizer.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. You've seen things with your own eyes, Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes; I suppose so.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. And you know how to tell about them. And you've such an engaging
      way about you...nobody could help but take to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Cut out the taffy. Who's your friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Her name's Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. A woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. A girl, yes. And she's coming right along, Jack. You must take a
      little trouble with her, for if we can only bring her through, she can do
      a lot for us. She's got no end of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No relative of Jim Hegan, I hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. She's his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [With a bound.] What!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. His only daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Good God, Julia!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. You know I don't want to meet people like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I don't care to mix with them. I've nothing to say to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. My dear Jack, the girl can't help her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I know that, and I'm sorry for her. But, meantime, I've got my work
      to do...
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. You couldn't be doing any better work than this. If we can make a
      Socialist of Laura Hegan...
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh, stuff, Julia! I've given up chasing after will-o'-the-wisps like
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA.&mdash;But think what she could do!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes. I used to think what a whole lot of people could do. You might
      as well ask me to think what her father could do... if he only wanted to
      do it, instead of poisoning the life-blood of the city, and piling up his
      dirty millions. Go about this town and see the misery and horror... and
      think that it's Jim Hegan who sits at the top and reaps the profit of it
      all! It's Jim Hegan who is back of the organization... he's the real power
      behind Boss Grimes. It's he who puts up the money and makes possible this
      whole regime of vice and graft...
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. My dear boy, don't be silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. How do you mean? Isn't it true?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Of course it's true... but why declaim to me about it? You forget
      you are talking to the champion female muckraker of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes, that's right. But I don't want to meet these people socially.
      They mean well, a lot of them, I suppose; but they've been accustomed all
      their lives to being people of importance... to have everybody stand in
      awe of them, because of their stolen money, and all the wonderful things
      they might do with it if they only would.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. My dear Jack, did you ever observe anything of the tuft-hunter in
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No, I don't know that I have. But it's never too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Laughing.] Well, until you do, have a little faith in me! Meet
      Laura Hegan, and judge for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Grumbling.] All right, I'll meet her. But let me tell you, I don't
      propose to spare her feelings. She'll get things straight from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. That's all right, my boy. Give her the class war and the Revolution
      with a capital R! Tell her you're the only original representative of the
      disinherited proletariat, and that some day, before long, you intend to
      plant the red flag over her daddy's palace. [Seriously.] Of course, what
      you'll actually do is meet her like a gentleman, and tell her of some of
      your adventures in Russia, and give her some idea of what's going on
      outside of her little Fifth avenue set. J ACK. Where did you run on to
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I met her at the settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Good Lord! Jim Hegan's daughter! [Laughs.] They were toadying to her
      there, I'll wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Well, you know what settlement people are. She's been coming there
      for quite a while, and seems to be interested. She's given them quite a
      lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I had a little talk with her one afternoon. She's a quiet,
      self-contained girl, but she gave me a peculiar impression. She seemed to
      be unhappy; there was a kind of troubled note in what she said. I had felt
      uncomfortable about meeting her... you can imagine, after my study of
      "Tammany and the Traction Trust."
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Did she mention that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. No, she never has. But I've several times had the feeling that she
      was trying to get up the courage to do it. I've thought, somehow, that she
      must be suffering about her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. My God! Wouldn't it be a joke if Nemesis were to get at Jim Hegan
      through his daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Yes; wouldn't it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. How do you suppose he takes her reform activities?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I don't know, but I fancy they must have had it out. She's not the
      sort of person to let herself be turned back when her mind's made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. A sort of chip of the old block. [After a pause.] If I'd known what
      was up, I wouldn't have suggested asking anybody else to come.. .
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Oh, that's all right; it won't make any difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. This chap, Montague, that I 'phoned to you about... he's a sort of a
      convert of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I see. We'll reciprocate.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I think I've got Montague pretty well landed. You'll be interested
      in him... it's quite a story. It was last election day...
    </p>
    <p>
      [The bell rings.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Ah, there's somebody. [She goes to the door; calls.] Is that you,
      Miss Hegan?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Off.] Yes, it's I.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. You found your way, did you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh, no trouble at all. [Enters, a tall, stately girl, about
      twenty-three; simply but elegantly clad.] How do you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I am so glad to see you. Jack, this is Miss Hegan. Mr. Bullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. How do you do, Mr. Bullen?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I am very glad to meet you, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Let me take your things.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Looking about.] Oh, what a cozy place! I think these model
      tenements are delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. They're indispensable to us agitators... an oasis in a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Built for the proletariat, and inhabited by cranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is that the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. It's certainly the truth about this one. Below me are two painters
      and a settlement worker, and next door is a blind Anarchist and a Yiddish
      poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What's the reason for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Going to room off left with LAURA's things.] The places are clean
      and cheap; and whenever the poor can't pay their rent, we take their
      homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. The elimination of the unfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It sounds like a tragic explanation; but I guess it's true.
      [Looking at Jack.] And so this is Mr. Bullen. For such a famous
      revolutionist, I expected to find some one more dangerous-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Returning.] Don't make up your mind too soon about Jack. He's
      liable to startle you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I'm not easily startled any more. I'm getting quite used to meeting
      revolutionists.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. You don't call them revolutionists that you meet at the settlement,
      I hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; but all sorts of people come there.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. By the way, Jack 'phoned me this afternoon, and said he'd invited a
      friend here. I hope you don't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Why, no; not at all. Is it one of your Russian friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh, no; he's an American. His name is Montague. I was just starting
      to tell Julia about him when you came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Go ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. It was quite an adventure. I don't know that I've ever had one that
      was more exciting. And I've had quite some, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes; I've been told so.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. It was last election day, in a polling place on the Bowery. I was a
      watcher for the Socialists, and this Montague was one of the watchers for
      the reform crowd. The other one was drunk, and so he had the work all to
      himself. It was in the heart of Leary's district, and the crowd there was
      a tough one, I can tell you. It was a close election.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes; I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. There'd been all kinds of monkey-work going on, and the box was full
      of marked and defective ballots, and Montague set to work to make them
      throw them out. I didn't pay much attention at first. I was only there to
      see that our own ballots were counted; but pretty soon I began to take
      interest. He had every one in the place against him. There was a Tammany
      inspector of elections and four tally clerks... all in with Tammany, of
      course. There were three or four Tammany policemen, and, outside of the
      railing, the worst crowd of toughs that ever you laid eyes on. To make
      matters worse, there were several men inside who had no business to be
      there... one of them a Judge of the City Court, and another a State's
      attorney... and all of them storming at Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. What did he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. He just made them throw out the marked ballots. They were willing
      enough to put them to one side, but wanted to count them in on the tally
      sheets. And, of course, Montague knew perfectly well that if they ever
      counted them in they'd close up at the end, and that would be all there
      was to it. He had the law with him, of course. He's a lawyer himself, and
      he seemed to know it all by heart; and he'd quote it to them, paragraph by
      paragraph, and they'd look it up and find that he was right, and, of
      course, that only made them madder. The old Judge would start up in his
      seat. "Officer!" he'd shout (he was a red-faced, ignorant fellow... a
      typical barroom politician), "I demand that you put that man out of here."
      And the cop actually laid his hand on Montague's shoulder; if he'd ever
      been landed on the other side of that railing the crowd would have torn
      him to pieces. But the man stayed as cool as a cucumber. "Officer," he
      said, "you are aware that I am an election official, here under the
      protection of the law; and if you refuse me that protection you are liable
      to a sentence in State's prison." Then he'd quote another paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. It's a wonder he ever held them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. He did it; he made them throw out forty-seven ballots... and
      thirty-eight of them were Tammany ballots, too. There was one time when I
      thought the gang was going to break loose, and I sneaked out and
      telephoned for help. Then I came back and spoke up for him. I wanted them
      to know there'd be one witness. You should have seen the grateful look
      that Montague gave me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I can imagine it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. And how did it end?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Why, you see, we kept them there till eleven o'clock at night, and
      by that time everybody knew that Tammany had won, and the ballots were not
      needed. So the old Judge patted us on the back and told us we were heroes,
      and invited us out to get drunk with him. Montague and I walked home
      together through the election din, and got acquainted. I don't know that I
      ever met a man I took to more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You are making a Socialist out of him, of course?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh, he's coming on. But he is not the sort of man to take his ideas
      from any one else... he wants to see for himself. He hasn't been in New
      York long, you know... he comes from the South... from Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Startled.] From Mississippi! What's his first name?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Allan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Betraying emotion.] Allan Montague!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Do you know him?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes; I know him very well, indeed. Oh... I didn't... that is... I
      have not seen him for a long time. [Recovering her poise.] Is he surely
      coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. He generally keeps his engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. How did you come to know him?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He's Ollie Montague's brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Who's Ollie Montague?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He's one of those pretty boys that everybody knows in society; he
      brought his brother up from the South to introduce him. He was in some
      business deal or other with my father. Then he seemed to drop out of
      everything, and nobody sees him any more. I don't know why.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I think he was disgusted with his experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Realizing that he had said something awkward.] I think I was the
      first Socialist he'd ever met. He had just gotten to the stage of despair.
      He'd started out with a long program of reforms... and he was going to
      educate the people to them... one by one, until he'd made them all
      effective. I said to him: "By the time you've got the attention of the
      public on reform number thirty... what do you suppose the politicians will
      have been doing with reform number one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. We all have to go through that stage. I can remember just as
      well... [A ring upon the bell.] Ah, there he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Rises and goes to the door.] But I think he's most through butting
      his head against the stone wall! [Calls.] Are you there, old man?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Off.] I'm here!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. How are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Fine!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Come right in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Enters; a tall, handsome man of thirty; self-contained and slow
      of speech; the dark type of a Southerner.] I'm a trifle late. [Sees LAURA;
      starts.] Miss Hegan! You! [Recovers himself.] Why... an unexpected
      pleasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Unexpected on both sides, Mr. Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I'm delighted to meet you, really!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They shake hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Julia, my friend, Mr. Montague. Miss Patterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I'm very glad to meet you, Miss Patterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. We had no idea we were bringing old friends together.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. No; it was certainly a coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It's been... let me see... a year since we've met.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It must be fully that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Where do you keep yourself these days?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Oh, I'm studying, in a quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And none of your old friends ever see you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I don't get about much.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Earnestly.] And friendship means so little to you as that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I... it would be hard to explain. I have been busy with
      politics...
    </p>
    <p>
      [A pause of embarrassment.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Mr. Bullen has just been telling us about your heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. My heroism? Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. At the polling place.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Oh, that! It was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It seemed like a good deal to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Make him tell you about some of his own adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Would you ever think, to look at his innocent countenance, that he
      had helped to hold a building for six hours against Russian artillery?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Good heavens! Where was this?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. During the St. Petersburg uprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And weren't you frightened to death?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Laughing.] No; we were too busy taking pot-shots at the Cossacks.
      It was like the hunting season in the Adirondacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And how did it turn out?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh, they were too much for us in the end. I got away, across the ice
      of the Neva... I had the heel of one shoe shot off. And yet people tell us
      romance is dead! Anybody who is looking for romance, and knows what it is,
      can find all he wants in Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [To MONTAGUE.] Have you seen my father lately?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. No; not for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You may see him this evening. He promised to call for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh, by the way, Julia, I forgot! How's Annie?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh, yes; how is she?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. She's doing well, I think. Better every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is she still violent?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Not so much. I can always handle her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is she in the next room?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking to the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Yes. She's been asleep since afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you still won't let me send her to a hospital?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Oh, no. Truly, it would kill the poor girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But you... with all your work, and your engagements?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. She's very quiet. And the neighbors come in and help when I'm out.
      They all sympathize.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Talking about heroism... it seems to me that you are entitled to
      mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Why, nonsense!... the girl was simply thrown into my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Most people would have managed to step out of the way, just the
      same. You've heard the story, have you, Mr. Montague?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Bullen has told it to me. You haven't been able to get any
      justice?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. From the police? Hardly! But we're keeping at it, to make the story
      complete. I went to see Captain Quinn to-day. "What's this?" says he.
      "Annie Rogers again? Didn't your lady frien' get her pitcher in the papers
      over that case? An' what more does she want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I went this afternoon to see the Tammany leader of our district...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Leary?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. The same. I went straight into his saloon. "Lady," says he, "the
      goil's nutty! You got a bughouse patient on your bands! This here talk
      about the white-slave traffic, ma'am... it's all the work o' these
      magazine muckrakers!" "Meaning myself, Mr. Leary?" said I, and he looked
      kind of puzzled. I don't think he knew who I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. All the work of the muckrakers! I see Boss Grimes is out to that
      effect also.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. And I see that half a dozen clergymen sat down to a public banquet
      with him the other day. That's what we've come to in New York! Bob Grimes,
      with his hands on every string of the whole infamous system... with his
      paws in every filthy graft-pot in the city! Bob Grimes, the type and
      symbol of it all! Every time I see a picture of that bulldog face, it
      seems to me as if I were confronting all the horrors that I've ever fought
      in my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. It's curious to note how much less denunciation of Tammany one
      hears now than in the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Tammany's getting respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. The big interests have found out how to use it. The traction gang,
      especially...
    </p>
    <p>
      [He stops abruptly; a tense pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Leaning toward him, with great earnestness.] Mr. Bullen, is that
      really true?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. That is true, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Mr. Bullen, you will understand what it means to me to hear that
      statement made. I hear it made continually, and I ask if it is true, and I
      am told that it is a slander. How am I to know? [A pause.] Would you be
      able to tell me that you know it of your own personal knowledge?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Weighing the words.] No; I could not say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Would you say that you could prove it to a jury?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I would say, that if I had to prove it, I could get the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What would you say, Mr. Montague?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I would rather not say, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Please! Please! I want you to answer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [After a pause.] I would say that I shall be able to prove it
      very shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. How do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I have been giving most of my time to a study of just that
      question, and I think that I shall have the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She sinks back, very white; a pause; the bell rings.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Who can that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Springing up.] Let me answer it. [Presses button; then, to
      MONTAGUE.] I had no idea you were going in for that, old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. This is the first time I have ever mentioned it to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Rising, hoping to relieve an embarrassing situation.] I hope this
      isn't any more company.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [To MONTAGUE, aside.] You must let me tell you a few things that I
      know. I've been running down a little story about Grimes and the traction
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Indeed! What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I can't tell it to you now... it would take too long. But, gee! If I
      can get the evidence, it'll make your hair stand on end! It has to do with
      the Grand Avenue Railroad suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. The one that's pending in the Court of Appeals?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes. You see, Jim Hegan stands to lose a fortune by it, and I've
      reason to believe that there's some monkey-work being done with the Court.
      It happens that one of the judges has a nephew... a dissipated chap, who
      hates him. He's an old college friend of mine, and he's trying to get some
      evidence for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Good Lord!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. And think, it concerns Jim Hegan personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A knock at the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. I'll go.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Opens the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Without.] Good evening. Is Miss Hegan here?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Standing up.] Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Won't you come in?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Thank you. [Enters; a tall, powerfully built man, with a square
      jaw, wide, over-arching eyebrows, and keen eyes that peer at one; a
      prominent nose, the aspect of the predatory eagle; a man accustomed to let
      other people talk and to read their thoughts.] Why, Mr. Montague, you
      here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Mr. Hegan! Why, how do you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. We stumbled on each other by chance. Father, this is Miss
      Patterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I am very pleased to meet you, Miss Patterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. How do you do, Mr. Hegan?
    </p>
    <p>
      [They shake hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And Mr. Bullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      BULLEN. [Remaining where he is; stiffly.] Good evening, Mr. Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Good evening, sir. [Turns to LAURA.] My dear, I finished up
      downtown sooner than I expected, and I have another conference at the
      house. I stopped off to see if you cared to come now, or if I should send
      back the car for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I think you'd best send it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Why, yes... she only just got here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Won't you stop a minute?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. No. I really can't. Mr. Grimes is waiting for me downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Involuntarily.] Mr. Grimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Robert Grimes?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Surprised.] Yes. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Nothing; only we happened to be just talking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Aggressively.] We happen to have one of his victims in the next
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Perplexed.] One of his victims?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Protesting.] Jack!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. A daughter of the slums. One of the helpless girls who have to pay
      the tribute that he...
    </p>
    <p>
      [A piercing and terrifying scream is heard off right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Annie!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Runs off.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      [The screams continue.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Off.] Help! Help!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jack, who is nearest, leaps toward the door; but, before he can reach it,
      it is flung violently open.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Enters, delirious, her bare arms and throat covered with bruises,
      her hair loose, and her aspect wild; an Irish peasant girl, aged twenty.]
      No! No! Let me go!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rushes into the opposite corner, and cowers in terror.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Following her.] Annie! Annie!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Flings her off, and stretches out her arms.] What do you want with
      me? Help! Help! I won't do it! I won't stay! Let me alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Wild and frantic sobbing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Annie, dear! Annie! Look at me! Don't you know me? I'm Julia! Your
      own Julia! No one shall hurt you... no one!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Stares at her wildly.] He's after me still! He'll follow me here!
      He won't let me get away from him! Oh, save me!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. [Embracing her.] Listen to me, dear. Don't think of things like
      that. You are in my home... nothing can hurt you. Don't let these evil
      dreams take hold of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Stares, as if coming out of a trance.] Why didn't you help me
      before?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Come, dear... come.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. It's too late... too late! Oh... I can't forget about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. Yes, dear. I know...
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Seeing the others.] Who?...
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. They are all friends; they will help you. Come, dear... lie down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh, what shall I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Is led off, sobbing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIA. It will be all right, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit; a pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Promptly and ruthlessly.] It means that you have been seeing the
      white-slave traffic in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Quietly, but with suppressed passion.] Tens of thousands of girl
      slaves are needed for the markets of our great cities... for the lumber
      camps of the North, the mining camps of the West, the ditches of Panama.
      And every four or five years the supply must be renewed, and so the
      business of gathering these girl-slaves from our slums is one of the great
      industries of the city. This girl, Annie Rogers, a decent girl from the
      North of Ireland, was lured into a dance hall and drugged, and then taken
      to a brothel and locked in a third-story room. They took her clothing away
      from her, but she broke down her door at night and fled to the street in
      her wrapper and flung herself into Miss Patterson's arms. Two men were
      pursuing her... they tried to carry her off. Miss Patterson called a
      policeman... but he said the girl was insane. Only by making a disturbance
      and drawing a crowd was my friend able to save her. And now, we have been
      the rounds... from the sergeant at the station, and the police captain, to
      the Chief of Police and the Mayor himself; we have been to the Tammany
      leader of the district... the real boss of the neighborhood... and there
      is no justice to be had anywhere for Annie Rogers!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. You have my word for it, sir. And the reason for it is that this
      hideous traffic is one of the main cogs in our political machine. The
      pimps and the panders, the cadets and maquereaux... they vote the ticket
      of the organization; they contribute to the campaign funds; they serve as
      colonizers and repeaters at the polls. The tribute that they pay amounts
      to millions; and it is shared from the lowest to the highest in the
      organization... from the ward man on the street and the police captain, up
      to the inner circle of the chiefs of Tammany Hall... yes, even to your
      friend, Mr. Robert Grimes, himself! A thousand times, sir, has the truth
      about this monstrous infamy been put before the people of your city; and
      that they have not long ago risen in their wrath and driven its agents
      from their midst is due to but one single fact... that this infamous
      organization of crime and graft is backed at each election time by the
      millions of the great public service corporations. It is they...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Interfering.] Bullen!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Let me go on! It is they, sir, who finance the thugs and repeaters
      who desecrate our polls. It is they who suborn our press and blind the
      eyes of our people. It is they who are responsible for this traffic in the
      flesh of our women. It is they who have to answer for the tottering reason
      of that poor peasant girl in the next room!

      LAURA. [Has been listening to this speech, white with horror; as the
      indictment proceeds, she covers her face with her hands; at this point she
      breaks into uncontrollable weeping.] Oh! I can't stand it!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Springing to her side.] My dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Clasping him.] Father! Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My child! I have begged you not to come to these places! Why should
      you see such things?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Wildly.] Why should I not see them, so long as they exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Angrily.] I won't have it. This is the end of it! I mean what I
      say! Come home with me!... Come home at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. With Grimes? I won't meet that man!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Very well, then. You need not meet him. I'll call a cab, and take
      you myself. Where are your things?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Looking to the left.] In that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Come, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Takes her off.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Turns to MONTAGUE, and to JULIA, who appears in doorway at right.]
      We gave it to them straight that time, all right!

      ACT II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Library of "The Towers," HEGAN's Long Island country place. A spacious
      room, furnished luxuriously, but with good taste. A large table, with lamp
      and books in the centre, and easy-chairs beside it. Up stage are French
      windows leading to a veranda, with drive below; a writing desk between the
      windows. Entrance right and left. A telephone stand left, and a clock on
      wall right. [At rise: ANDREWS, standing by the table, opening some
      letters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Enters from veranda.] Good afternoon, Mr. Andrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Good afternoon, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Has father come yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. No; he said he'd he back about five.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is he surely coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Oh, yes. He has an important engagement here.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He's working very hard these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. He has a good deal on his mind just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It's this Grand Avenue Railroad business.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Yes. If it should go against him, it would confuse his plans very
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is the matter never going to be decided?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. We're expecting the decision any day now. That's why he's so much
      concerned. He has to hold the market, you see...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. The decision's liable to affect the market?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Oh, yes... very much, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see. And then...
    </p>
    <p>
      'Phone rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Excuse me. Hello! Yes, this is Mr. Hegan's place. Mr. Montague?
      Why, yes; I believe he's to be here this afternoon. Yes.. . wait a
      moment... [To LAURA.] It's some one asking for Mr. Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Who is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Hello! Who is this, please? [TO LAURA.] It's Mr. Bullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Mr. Bullen? I'll speak to him. [Takes 'phone.] Hello, Mr. Bullen!
      This is Miss Hegan. I'm glad to hear from you. How are you? Why, yes, Mr.
      Montague is coming out... I expect him here any time. He was to take the
      three-five... just a moment. [Looks at clock.] If the train's on time,
      he's due here now. We sent to meet him. Call up again in about five
      minutes. Oh, you have to see him? As soon as that? Nothing wrong, I hope.
      Well, he couldn't get back to the city until after six. Oh, then you're
      right near us. Why don't you come over?... That's the quickest way. No;
      take the trolley and come right across. I'll be delighted to see you.
      What's that? Why, Mr. Bullen! How perfectly preposterous! My father
      doesn't blame you for what happened. Don't think of it. Come right along.
      I'll take it ill of you if you don't... truly I will. Yes; please do.
      You'll just have time to get the next trolley. Get off at the Merrick
      road, and I'll see there's an auto there to meet you. Very well. Good-bye.
      [TO ANDREWS.] Mr. Andrews, will you see there's a car sent down to the
      trolley to meet Mr. Bullen?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. All right.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Stands by table, in deep thought, takes a note from table and
      studies it; shakes her head.] He didn't want to come. He doesn't want to
      talk to me. But he must! Ah, there he is. [Sound of a motor heard. She
      waits, then goes to the window.] Ah, Mr. Montague!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Enters centre.] Good afternoon, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You managed to catch the train, I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes. I just did.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is so good of you to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Not at all. I am glad to be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I just had a telephone call from Mr. Bullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Starting.] From Bullen?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes. He said he had to see you about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Eagerly.] Where was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He was at his brother's place. I told him to come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Oh! Is he coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes; he'll be here soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Thank you very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He said it was something quite urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes. He has some important papers for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see he made a speech last night that stirred up the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Smiling.] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He is surely a tireless fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It's such men as Bullen who keep the world moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And do you agree with him, Mr. Montague?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That the end of it all is to be a revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I don't know, Miss Hegan. I find I am moving that way. I used to
      think we could control capital. Now I am beginning to suspect that it is
      in the nature of capital to have its way, and that if the people wish to
      rule they must own the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [After a pause.] Mr. Montague, I had to ask you to come out and see
      me, because I'd promised my father I would not go into the city again for
      a while. I've not been altogether well since that evening at Julia's.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I am sorry to hear that, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It's nothing, but it worries my father, you know. [pause.] I
      thought we should be alone this afternoon, but I find that my father is
      coming and... and Mr. Baker is coming also. So I mayn't have time to say
      all I wished to say to you. But I must thank you for coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I was very glad to come, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I can appreciate your embarrassment at being asked to...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. We must deal frankly with each other. I know that you did not want
      to come. I know that you have tried to put an end to our friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Hesitates.] Miss Hegan, let me explain my position.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I think I understand it already. You have found evil conditions
      which you wish to oppose, and you were afraid that our friendship might
      stand in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [In a low voice.] Miss Hegan, I came to New York an entire
      stranger two years ago, and my brother introduced me to his rich friends.
      By one of them I was asked to take charge of a law case. It was a case of
      very great importance, which served to give me an opening into the inner
      life of the city. I discovered that, in their blind struggle for power,
      our great capitalists had lost all sense of the difference between honesty
      and crime. I found that trust funds were being abused... that courts and
      legislatures were being corrupted... the very financial stability of the
      country was being wrecked. The thing shocked me to the bottom of my soul,
      and I set to work to give the public some light on the situation. Then,
      what happened, Miss Hegan? My newly made rich friends cut me a deal; they
      began to circulate vile slanders about me... they insulted me openly, on
      more than one occasion. So, don't you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes. I see. But could you not have trusted a friendship such as
      ours?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I did not dare.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You saw that you had to fight my father, and you thought that I
      would blindly take his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Hesitating.] I... I couldn't suppose...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Listen. You have told me your situation; now imagine mine. Imagine
      a girl brought up in luxury, with a father whom she loves very dearly, and
      who loves her more than any one else in the world. Everything is done to
      make her happy... to keep her contented and peaceful. But as she grows up,
      she reads and listens... and, little by little, it dawns upon her that her
      father is one of the leaders in this terrible struggle that you have
      spoken of. She hears about wrongdoing; she is told that her father's
      enemies have slandered him. At first, perhaps, she believes that. But time
      goes on... she sees suffering and oppression... she begins to realize a
      little of cause and effect. She wants to help, she wants to do right, but
      there is no way for her to know. She goes to one person after another, and
      no one will deal frankly with her. No one will tell her the truth...
      absolutely no one! [Leaning forward with intensity.] No one! No one!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. So it was with you... and with our friendship. I knew that you had
      broken it off for such reasons. I knew that there was nothing personal...
      it was nothing that I had done...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. No! Surely not!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Gazes about nervously.] And then the other night... you told me
      you were investigating the traction companies of New York.. . their
      connection with politics, and so on. Ever since then I have felt that you
      were the one person I must talk with. Don't you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes; I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have sought for some one who will tell me the truth. Will you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [In a low voice.] You must realize what you are asking of me,
      Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have not brought you here without realizing that. You must help
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Very well. I will do what I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Leaning forward.] I wish to know about my father. I wish to know
      to what extent he is involved in these evils that you speak of.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Your father is in the game, and he has played it the way the
      game is played.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Has he been better than the others, or worse?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. About the same, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He has been more successful than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. He has been very successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You were concerned in some important deal with my father, were you
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then you withdrew. Was that because there was something wrong in
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It was, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. There were corrupt things done?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. There were many kinds of corrupt things done.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And was my father responsible for them?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Directly?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes; directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then my father is a bad man? MONTAGUE. [After a pause.] Your father
      finds himself in the midst of an evil system. He is the victim of
      conditions which he did not create.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Ah, now you are trying to spare me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. No. I should say that to any one. I am at war with the system...
      not with individuals. It is the old story of hating the sin and loving the
      sinner. Your father's rivals are just as reckless as he take Murdock, for
      instance, the man who is behind this Grand Avenue Railroad matter. It is
      hard for a woman to understand that situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I can understand some things very clearly. I go down into the slums
      and I see all that welter of misery. I see the forces of evil that exist
      there, defiant and hateful... the saloons and the gambling-houses, and
      that ghastly white-slave traffic, of which Annie Rogers is the victim. And
      there is the political organization, taking its toll from all these, and
      using it to keep itself in power. And there is Boss Grimes, who is at the
      head of all... and he is one of my father's intimate associates. I ask
      about it, and I am told that it is a matter of "business." But why should
      my father do business with a man whose chief source of income is vice?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. That is not quite the case, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Doesn't the vice tribute go to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Part of it does, I have no doubt. But it would be a very small
      part of his income.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What then?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. The vice graft serves for the police and the district leaders
      and the little men; what really pays nowadays is what has come to be
      called "honest graft."
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. The business deals that are trade with the public service
      corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Ah! That is what I wish to know about!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. For instance, I am running a street railway...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Quickly.] My father is running them all!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Very well. Your father is in alliance with the organization; he
      is given franchises and public privileges for practically nothing; and in
      return he gives the contracts for constructing the subways and street-car
      lines to companies organized by the politicians. These companies are
      simply paper companies... they farm out the contracts to the real
      builders, skimming off a profit of twenty or thirty per cent. One of these
      companies received contracts last year to the value of thirty million
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And so that is how Grimes gets his money?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Grimes' brother is the president of the company I have reference
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see; it is a regular system.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It is a business, and there is no way to punish it... it does
      not violate any law...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And yet it is quite as bad!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It is far worse, because of its vast scope. It carries every
      form of corruption in its train. It means the prostitution of our whole
      system of government... the subsidizing of our newspapers, and of the
      great political parties. It means that judges are chosen who will decide
      in favor of the corporations; that legislators are nominated who will
      protect them against attack. It means everywhere the enthronement of
      ignorance and incompetence, of injustice and fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And in the end the public pays for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. In the end the public pays for everything. The stolen franchises
      are unloaded on the market for ten times what they cost, and the people
      pay their nickels for a wretched, broken-down service. They pay for it in
      the form of rent and taxes for a dishonest administration. Every
      struggling unfortunate in the city pays for it, when he comes into contact
      with the system... when he seeks for help, or even for justice. It was
      that side of it that shocked me most of all... I being a lawyer, you see.
      The corrupting of our courts...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. The judges are bought, Mr. Montague?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. The judges are selected, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Selected! I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. And that system prevails from the Supreme Court of the State
      down to the petty Police Magistrates, before whom the poor come to plead.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And that is why the white-slave traffic goes unpunished!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. That is why.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And why no one would move a hand for Annie Rogers!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. That is why.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And my father is responsible for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Gravely.] Yes; I think he is, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PAUSE.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Have you seen Julia Patterson lately?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I saw her last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And how is Annie?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. She... [Hesitates.] She is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starting.] Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. She died the night before last.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Stares at him, then gives a wild start, and cries] She... she...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. She killed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. She cut her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Hides her face and sinks against the table, shuddering and
      overcome.] Oh, the poor girl! The poor, poor girl! [Suddenly she springs
      up.] Can't you see? Can't you see? It is things like that that are driving
      me to distraction!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Starting toward her.] Miss Hegan...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Covering her face again.] Oh! oh! It is horrible! I can't stand
      it! I...
    </p>
    <p>
      [Sound of motor heard; they listen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That is my father's car... Mr. Montague, will you excuse me? I must
      have a talk with my father...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Certainly. Let me go away...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; please wait. Just take a little stroll. I...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Certainly, I understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Seeks to compose herself; then goes to window.] Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Off.] Yes, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Enters.] What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father, I have just had dreadful news..
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Annie Rogers... that poor girl, you know...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. She has killed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. She cut her own throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Oh, my dear! [Starts toward her.] I am so sorry...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Quickly.] No, father! Listen! You must talk to me... you must talk
      to me this time!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My child...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You cannot put me off. You cannot, I tell you!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Laura, dear, you are upset...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No! That is not so! I have perfect control of myself. There is no
      use crying... the girl is dead. That can't be helped. But I mean to
      understand about it. I mean to know who is responsible for her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear, these evils are hard to know of...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That house to which that girl was taken... there is a law against
      such places, is there not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And why is not the law enforced?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. It has not been found possible to enforce such laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, my dear, this evil...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. These people pay money to the police, do they not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, yes; I imagine...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Don't tell me what you imagine... tell me what you know! They pay
      money to the police, don't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then why should the police not be punished? Do those who control
      the police get some of the money?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Some of them, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That is, the leaders of Tammany.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Possibly... yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And Mr. Grimes... he gets some of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, my dear...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Tell me!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But really, Laura, I never asked him what he gets.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [With intensity.] Father, you must understand me! I will not be
      trifled with... I am in desperate earnest! I am determined to get to the
      bottom of this thing! I am no longer a child, and you must not try to
      deceive me! Mr. Grimes must get some of that money!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I think it possible, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And do you get any?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Good God, Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then what is the nature of your relationship with Grimes?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Really, my child, this is not fair of you. I have business
      connections which you cannot possibly understand...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I can understand everything that you are willing for me to
      understand! I want to know why you must have business connections with a
      man like Boss Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear, I think you might take your father's word in such a case.
      It has nothing to do with vice, I can assure you. Grimes is a business
      ally of mine. He is a rich man, a great power in New York...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Do you help to keep him a power in New York?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, I don't know...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Do you contribute to his campaign funds?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, Laura! I am a Democrat. Surely I have a right to support my
      party!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Quickly.] Have you ever contributed to the Republican campaign
      funds?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Disconcerted; laughs.] Why... really...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Please answer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I am a Gold Democrat, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see. [She Pauses.] You put Mr. Grimes in the way of making a
      great deal of money, do you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He is interested in companies that you give contracts to?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Really! You seem to be informed about my affairs!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have taken some trouble to inform myself. Father, don't you
      realize what it means to corrupt the government of the city in this way?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Corrupt the government, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Does not Grimes have the nominating of judges and legislators?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, yes... in a way...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And does he not consult with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, my dear...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Please tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Realizing that he cannot make any more admissions.] No, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Never?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Absolutely never.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He has never made any attempt to influence the courts in your
      favor?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Never.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Not in any way, father?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Not in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Nor in favor of your companies?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. No, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You mean, you can give me your word of honor that that is the
      truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I can, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And that none of your lawyers do it? Do you mean that the courts
      escape your influence...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Laughing disconcertedly.] Really, my dear, this is as bad as a
      Government investigation! I shall have to take refuge in a lapse of
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Intensely.] Father! Is it nothing to you that I have the blood of
      that poor girl on my conscience?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My child!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes; just that! She was caught in the grip of this ruthless system;
      it held her fast and crushed her life out. And we maintain this system! I
      profit by it... all this luxury and power that I enjoy comes from it
      directly! Can't you see what I mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I see, my dear, that you are frightfully overwrought, and that you
      are making yourself ill. Can't you imagine what it means to me to have you
      acting in this way? Here I am at one of the gravest crises of my life; I
      am working day and night, under frightful strain... I have hardly slept
      six hours in the past three days. And here, when I get a chance for a
      moment's rest, you come and put me through such an ordeal! You never think
      of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It's just what I do think of! Why must you torture yourself so?
      Why...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear, I, too, am in the grip of the system you speak of.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But why? Why stay in it? Haven't we money enough yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I have duties by which I am bound... interests that I must protect.
      How can I... [A knock.] Come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Enters.] Here are the papers, Mr. Hegan. They must be signed now
      if they're to catch this mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. All right.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Sits at desk up stage and writes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Stands by table, staring before her; picks up book carelessly from
      table.] "Ivanhoe"... [Fingers it idly and a slip of paper falls to floor.
      She picks it up, glances at it, then starts.] Oh!.. . [Reads.] "Memo to
      G., two hundred thousand on Court deal. GRIMES." Two hundred thousand on
      Court deal! [Glances back at her father; then replaces slip and lays book
      on table.] Father, have you read "Ivanhoe"?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Without looking up.] I'm reading it now. Why? Do you want it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; I just happened to notice it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Looks up sharply, watches her, then finishes writing.] There!
      [Rises; the sound of a motor heard.] What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Near window.] It's Mr. Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starting.] Grimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [TO ANDREWS.] Bring him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      [ANDREWS exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father! Why do you bring that man here?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I'll not do it again, dear. I didn't realize. He happened to be in
      the neighborhood...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I won't meet him!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Putting his arm about her.] Very well, dear; come away. Try to
      stop worrying yourself now, for the love of me...
    </p>
    <p>
      [Leads her off left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [At window.] This way, Mr. Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      [GRIMES enters; a powerfully built, broad-shouldered man of about fifty,
      with a massive jaw, covered with a scrubby beard; the face of a bulldog; a
      grim, masterful man, who never speaks except when he has to. He enters and
      seats himself in a chair by the table.] Will you have a cigar? [Grimes
      takes a cigar, without comment, and chews on it; sits, staring in front of
      him.] Mr. Hegan will be here directly, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He nods, and ANDREWS exit. GRIMES continues to chew and stare in front of
      him. He is not under the necessity of making superfluous motions.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Enters left.] Hello, Grimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Hello!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Betraying anxiety.] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. It's done.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. It's done.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Good! [Grimes nods.] How did you manage it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Grimly.] I put my hand on 'em!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Which one? Porter? [GRIMES nods.] Oh, the old hypocrite! What did
      you offer him? Cash? [GRIMES shakes his head slowly.] What?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Discipline!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Perplexed.] But... a judge!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. When a man's once mine, he stays mine... no matter if it's a life
      job I give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MEGAN. But are you sure it's safe?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. The decision comes tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Starting.] What?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Tomorrow noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But how can they write the decision?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. They'll adopt the minority opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Oh! I see!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Chuckles.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. You be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      MEGAN. Trust me! I'll have to go in now.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. It'll be a great killing. Old Murdock has plunged up to his neck!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I know! We'll lay them flat. I'll get ready. [Rises.] Old Porter!
      Think of it! When did you see him?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I see. I'll be with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Just a moment. I'll take the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Oh, yes. Why don't you let me hold it and buy for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I'll buy for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Sits at desk.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. It's two hundred thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. That's right. [Writes a check, rises and gives it to Grimes.]
      There.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Studies the check, nods, and puts it away carefully.] When's the
      next train?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. In about ten minutes. [Rings bell.] Andrews!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Enters left.] Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I'm going into town at once. Telephone orders to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Yes, sir. And shall I come in this evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes; you'd better. And telephone Mr. Isaacson and Mr. Henry Sterns
      to meet me at eight o'clock for an important conference at.. . let me see,
      where?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. At my rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Very good. And they're not to fail on any account. It's urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      [HEGAN and GRIMES go off centre. ANDREWS remains sorting papers. A knock,
      right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      [MONTAGUE enters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Oh, good afternoon. I was looking for you, Mr. Montague. Mr.
      Bullen has come.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Oh! Where is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. He's waiting. I'll tell him you're here.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Stands at window and sees motor departing.] Grimes! I wonder
      what that means? [Turns away.] And what a coincidence, that I should be
      here! Humph! Well, it's not my doings. Ah! Bullen!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Enters, right, in great excitement.] Montague!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I've got 'em!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I've got 'em!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. You don't mean it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Got 'em dead! Got everything! There's never been a case like it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Gazing about.] Ssh! Where was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. At Judge Porter's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes.... Grimes came there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. When?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Last night. My friend was in the next room... he heard everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. And what are they going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Porter is to switch over, and sign the minority opinion, and that's
      to come out as the decision of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Good God! When?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. There's to be a meeting of the judges this afternoon. See... here's
      the decision! [Takes paper from pocket.] The one they mean to kill!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Looks at paper.] Merciful heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. And look here! [Unfolds a paper, which has pasted on it bits of a
      torn and charred note.] He threw this in the fireplace, and it didn't
      burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Bullen!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. In Grimes' own handwriting: "My Dear Porter&mdash;I will call"...
      you can see what that word was... "at eight-thirty. Very urgent." How's
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Man, it's ghastly! [A pause.] How did you manage to get these?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. It's a long story.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. How did Grimes work it? Money?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Not a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. What then?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Just bluffed him. Party loyalty! What was he named for?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. But in a suit like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Never was a better test! If Hegan lost this case, he'd be wiped off
      the slate, and the organization might go down at the next election. And
      what were you put in for, judge Porter? Don't you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I see! It takes my breath away!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Looking about.] And what a place for us to meet in! Did you see
      Grimes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I'll wager he came to tell Hegan about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. No doubt of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. God! I'd give one hand to have heard them!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Don't wish that! It's embarrassing enough as it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Staring at him.] You'll see it through? You won't back out?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Oh, I'll see it through... trust me for that. But it's devilish
      awkward!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Why did you come here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I tried not to. But Miss Hegan insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Laughing.] The same here! I was fair caught!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. And now she'll think we learned it here. I'll have to explain to
      her...
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I Must!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No! [LAURA appears at windows, centre, and hears the rest, which is
      in excited tones.] It is not to be thought of!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. But I can't help it, man! Miss Hegan will think I've been
      eavesdropping!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Do you realize what you're proposing, man? You'll ruin everything!
      We've got Grimes dead... we can land him in jail! But if Hegan heard any
      whisper of it, they'd balk everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. But how?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. They'd hold up the decision of the Court...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Nonsense! With all that they'd stand to lose...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Coming forward.] I beg pardon, Mr. Bullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I didn't wish to hear what you were saying. But I couldn't help it.
      I was caught unawares. [The three stare at each other.] It is something
      that involves my father. [Looking at the papers in BULLEN's hands.] Mr.
      Bullen has brought you some evidence. Is that so, Mr. Montague?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [In a low voice.] Yes, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you wished to take me into your confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I wished to make it impossible for you to think we had obtained
      this evidence in your home.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I See.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. You will do us the justice to recognize that we did not seek
      admission here.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes; I do that. [A pause.] All that I can say is, that if you think
      it best to take me into your confidence, you may trust me to the bitter
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Miss Hegan, Mr. Bullen has brought me evidence which proves that
      the decision of the Court, which is to be made known tomorrow, has been...
      improperly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Quickly.] By whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. By Robert Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starts wildly.] And the evidence involves my father?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Your father will be the chief one to profit from the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Sinks back against the table; stares away from them, whispering.]
      To Grimes... two hundred thousand on Court deal! I see! I see! [Faces
      them, weakly.] And what... what do you mean to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I intend to wait until the decision has been announced, which
      will be tomorrow, and then to call a public meeting and present the
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starts to implore him; then controls herself.] Yes, yes... that is
      just. But then... see! It hasn't been done yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. How do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. The decision hasn't come out. It could be stopped!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Why stop it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That would prevent the wrong! I would... oh, I see! You want to
      expose Grimes! You'd rather it happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. The crime has already been committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you, Mr. Montague... you prefer it so?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I had never thought of any other possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Listen! I don't understand the matter very clearly. The Grand
      Avenue Railroad case...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It is an effort to annul a franchise which was obtained by
      proven bribery.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then, if the public could win, it would be worth while, would it
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It would establish a precedent of vast importance. But how could
      that be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. We have a hold upon these men... we could compel them to give way!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. They would never do it, Miss Hegan... they have too much at
      stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But... the evidence you have! Mr. Bullen said you could send Grimes
      to jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. That was just wild talk. Grimes has the district attorney and
      the courts. He could never be punished for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But the exposure!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. He's been exposed a hundred times. What does that matter to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But then... my father is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Quite true, Miss Hegan...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And I can make him see how wrong it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. You can make him see it! But you can't make him do anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Ah, but you don't know my father... truly, you don't. He does these
      evil things, but at heart he's a kind and loyal man! And he loves me... I
      am his only daughter... and I can help him to see what is right. We have
      always understood each other; he will listen to me as he would not to any
      one else in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. But what can you say to him? We can't put our evidence in your
      hands...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I don't need your evidence. I must tell you that I, too, have found
      out something about this case. I know that my father paid Mr. Grimes to
      influence the decision of that Court. And I know how much he paid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Miss Hegan!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Good God!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You see, I am not afraid to trust you.... [A pause.] What is the
      nature of your evidence against Grimes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It comes from an eye-witness of his interview with the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And it is some one you can trust?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It's for Bullen to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. The judge has a nephew, a dissipated chap, whose inheritance he is
      holding back... and who hates him in consequence. The nephew happens to be
      a college chum of mine. He witnessed the interview and he brought me the
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see. Then, certainly, I have a case. And don't you see what a
      hold that gives me upon my father?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Miss Hegan, you are a brave woman, and I would like to give way to
      you. But you could accomplish nothing. This suit, which is nominally in
      the public interest, is really backed by Murdock and his crowd, who are
      fighting your father; you must realize his position.. . the thousand ties
      that bind him... all the habits of a lifetime! Think of the friends he has
      to protect; you don't know...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I know it all. And, on the other hand, I know some things that you
      do not know. I know that my father is not a happy man. There is a canker
      eating at his heart... the fruit of life has turned to ashes on his lips.
      And he has one person in all this world that he loves.. . myself. He has
      toiled and fought for me... all these years he has told himself that he
      was making his money for me. And now he finds that it brings me only
      misery and grief... it is as useless to me as it is to him! And now,
      suppose I should go to him and say: "Father, you have committed a crime.
      And I cannot stand it another hour. You must choose here and now... you
      must give up this fight against the people... you must give up this
      career, and come with me and help me to do good in the world. Or else"...
      [her voice breaking.]... "I shall have to leave you! I shall refuse to
      touch a dollar of your money; I shall refuse in any way to share your
      guilt!" Don't you see? He will know that I am speaking the truth... and
      that I mean every word of it. Oh, gentlemen, believe me... my father would
      be as strong to atone for his injustices as he has been to commit them!
      Surely, you can't refuse me this chance to save him?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Miss Hegan...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. For God's sake, Jack...
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Excuse me, Montague. How long would you expect us to wait, Miss
      Hegan?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You need not wait at all. You could go right ahead with your own
      plans. Meantime, I can go to my father... I will have tonight to plead
      with him, and tomorrow morning you will know if I have succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Very well... I will consent to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Let Mr. Montague come to my father's office tomorrow morning at ten
      o'clock. I shall not give him up... even if I have to follow him there!
      And now... good-bye... [Starts toward the door, breaks down and cries.]
      Thank you! Thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stretches out her hands to them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Springing toward her.] Miss Hegan!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Give me a little courage! Tell me you think I shall succeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Seizing her hand.] I believe you will, Miss Hegan!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Ah! Thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Kisses her hand; tries to speak; overcome.] Good-bye!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Exit.] Ah, God!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I understand, old man! If only she weren't so rich!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. If only she weren't...
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes, yes, dear boy; I know how it is. You're troubled with a
      conscience, and yours must be strictly a cottage affair! But forget it
      just now, old fellow... we've got work before us. Play ball!
    </p>
    <p>

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEGAN'S office in Wall street. A large room, furnished with severe
      simplicity. At the left a large table, with half a dozen chairs about it,
      and a "ticker" near the wall; at the right, a flat-topped desk and a
      telephone. Entrance centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At rise: ANDREWS stands by desk; takes some papers, looks them over,
      makes note and replaces them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. [Enters.] Say, Andrews, what's the reply to these letters of the
      Fourth National?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Give them here; I'll see to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. Any orders for the brokers this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I'm writing them myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. Something special, eh? All right. [Looks at ticker.] Hello! Listen
      to this: "There is a rumor, widely current, that the decision of the Court
      of Appeals in the matter of the Public vs. the Grand Avenue Railroad
      Company will be handed down to-day!" Gee whiz, I wonder if that's so?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I have heard the rumor.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. There was a reporter here yesterday, trying to pump me. I'll bet
      they're watching the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Yes; no doubt of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. Cracky! I'd like to know which way it'll go!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. A good many others would like to know, I've no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. I'll bet my hat the boss knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. It may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A pause; PARKER continues to read ticker.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. I don't suppose you've heard anything, have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I never hear, Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. Oh, say... come off. Why don't you drop a fellow a hint now and
      then?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I can't afford to.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. It would never go beyond me. [A pause.] Say, Andrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. Would you like to invest a bit for me now and then?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I'm not hankering to, especially.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. I'll go halves with you on the profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. And how about the losses?
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. There wouldn't be any losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Cut it out, Parker... we don't want that kind of a thing in the
      office. [Handing him paper.] Here... I want three copies of this. And take
      my advice and live on your salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER. Thanks. I wish the salary increased as fast as the bills do!
      [Starts to door; sees LAURA.] Oh! Good morning, Miss Hegan!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Enters hurriedly.] Good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Good morning, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARKER exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Mr. Andrews, where was my father last night?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. He had an important conference...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He did not come to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. No, Miss Hegan; it was too late. He stayed downtown...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you were not home, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I was with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is too bad! I have been trying all night to find either of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Why... your father had no idea when he left...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I know. Something has turned up...
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Nothing wrong, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I must see my father as soon as possible. Ile will be here this
      morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Any minute, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He will surely come?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Not the slightest doubt of it. Nothing could keep him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I wish to see him the moment he comes. And if he should call up or
      send word...
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I will see that he is informed, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Thank you. [A pause.] The Court decision is expected to-day, is it
      not, Mr. Andrews?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Hesitates.] There has been a rumor, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And so there will be considerable disturbance of the market?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Presumably.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And my father has made preparations?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That is what the conference was about?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. I presume so, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. By the way, Mr. Andrews, I expect Mr. Montague here at ten o'clock.
      Please let me know when he comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Yes, Miss Hegan. [Goes to the door, then turns.] Here is Mr.
      Hegan now.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starting up.] Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Holding open door.] Good morning, Mr. Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Enters.] Good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, Laura! [ANDREWS exit.] What are you doing here?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I've come to have a talk with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. To have a talk with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Come in, please, father. Shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, my dear; but...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I came into the city on the next train after you. I have been
      hunting for you ever since... I have been up all night. I have something
      of the utmost urgency to talk with you about.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Come and sit down, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Listen, father. Yesterday afternoon, when we were talking, you told
      me that you had never done anything to influence the courts in their
      decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you told me that nobody else ever did it, either for you or for
      your companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, but...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And, father, you told me a falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I am very sorry, but I have to say it. It was a falsehood; and it
      is but one of many falsehoods that you have told me. I understand just why
      you did it you think I ought not to ask about these things, because it
      will make me unhappy; and so, for my own good, you do not hesitate to tell
      me things that are not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My child, it is your father that you are talking to!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is my father, and a father who knows that I love him very
      dearly, and who will realize it hurts me to say these things, fully as
      much as it hurts him to hear them. But they must be said... and said now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why now? Just at this moment...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I know what you are going to say. At this moment you are very
      busy...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear, the Exchange will open in an hour. And I am in the midst
      of a big campaign. I have important orders for my brokers, and a hundred
      other matters to attend to. And I expect Grimes here any minute...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Grimes?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You are not through with him yet, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. No, Laura...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Well, even so! Mr. Grimes must wait until I have said what I have
      to say to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What is it, Laura?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You are expecting the decision of the Court of Appeals on the Grand
      Avenue Railroad case at noon today.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why, yes...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. The decision will be in your favor. And you and Grimes are planning
      to gamble on it, and to make a great deal of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you paid Grimes two hundred thousand dollars to fix the
      decision of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Starting violently.] Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Grimes went to judge Porter's house the night before last and
      induced him to change his vote on the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And so, what was to have been the minority opinion of the Court is
      to be given out today as the Court's decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My God!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You do not deny that this is the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. You overheard us at the house!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Not one word, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But you must have!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father, throughout this conversation, you may honor me by assuming
      that I am telling you the absolute truth. And I will be glad when you will
      give me the same privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Then, how did you learn it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That, unfortunately, I am not at liberty to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Then other people know it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. They do.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Good God! [Stares at her, dumbfounded.] Who are these people?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I cannot tell you that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But, Laura... you must!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But... how can that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I cannot discuss the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But think... my dear! I am your father, and you must trust me...
      you must help me...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Please do not ask me. I have given my word.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Your word! [Gazes about, distracted.] You take the part of others
      against your own flesh and blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Listen, father! Think of me for a minute, and how it seems to me.
      Do not be so ignoble as to think only of the exposure...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But, my child, realize what it will mean if this comes out! Are
      these people among my enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That depends upon circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I don't understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I will try to explain, if you will be patient with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Go on! Go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father, you know what has been happening to me during the past few
      months. You know how unhappy I have been. And now you have committed a
      crime... a dreadful, dreadful crime!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I wish to make it clear to you... I am in desperate earnest. I have
      taken all night to think it over, and I am not making any mistake. I have
      made up my mind that, come what will, and cost what it may, I must clear
      myself of the responsibility for these evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. In what way are you responsible?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. In every way imaginable. My whole life is based upon them...
      everything that I have and enjoy is stained with the guilt of them... the
      house in which I live, the clothing that I wear, the food that I eat. And
      I shall never again know what it is to be happy, while I have that fact
      upon my conscience. Don't you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I tried all night to find you. I wanted to have a chance to talk
      with you, quietly. And, now, instead, I have to do it here, amid all the
      rush and strain of this dreadful Wall Street. But so it is.. . I must say
      it here. Father, I have come to plead with you, to plead with you upon my
      knees. Listen to me... don't turn me away!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What do you wish me to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. First of all, I wish you to give up this illegal advantage that you
      have gained. I wish you to stop this decision, and give the people the
      victory to which they are entitled.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But, my dear, that is madness! How can I...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You compelled Grimes to do this thing... you can compel him to undo
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But, my dear, it would ruin me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. If you do what I ask you to do, ruin will not matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. What do you ask me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I wish you to stop this mad career... to give up this money game...
      to drop it utterly! To stop selling stocks and manipulating markets; to
      stop buying politicians and franchises... to sell out everything... to
      withdraw. I want you to do it now... today.. . this very hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But, my dear...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I want you to come with me, and help me to find happiness again, by
      doing some good in the world. I want you to use your power and your
      talents to help people, instead of to destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My child! That is something very easy to talk about, but not so
      easy to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. We will work together, and find ways to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. It seems possible, from your point of view... with your noble
      ideals, and your sheltered life...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. My sheltered life! That is just what I can no longer endure! That I
      should have ease and comfort, while others suffer... that my father should
      take part in this mad struggle for money and power, in order to give me a
      sheltered life! I must make it impossible for that to continue! I must
      make you understand that all your money is powerless to bring me
      happiness... that it is poisoning my life as well as your own!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Gravely.] Laura, I have tried to protect you... that is the
      natural instinct of a father... to keep evil things from his daughter's
      knowledge. If I have told you untruths, as you say, that has been the one
      reason. But since you will not have it so... since you must face the facts
      of the world...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I Must!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Very well, then... you shall face them. You tell me to give up this
      case... to change back the Court's decision, so that the public may reap
      the advantage. Do you realize that the public has nothing to do with this
      suit?... That it is a covert attack upon me by an unscrupulous enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You mean Murdock?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Murdock. You know something of his career, perhaps... something of
      his private life, too. And if I should turn back, as you ask, the public
      would gain nothing... he would be the only one to profit. He would raid my
      securities; he would throw my companies into bankruptcy; he would draw my
      associates away from me... in the end, he would take my place in the
      traction field. Is that what you wish to bring about?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is not that that I am thinking of. It is the corrupting of the
      Court...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. The Court! Do you know why Grimes and I had to do what we did?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. And yet you have judged me! What would you say if I told you that
      we had information that one of the judges had received a thousand shares
      of Grand Avenue stock from Murdock? And that another had been promised a
      seat in the United States Supreme Court by that eminent Republican?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh! Horrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. You see what the game is?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But, father! The buying and selling of the powers of the
      Government...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. The "Government" consisting of politicians who have gotten
      themselves elected for the purpose of selling out to the highest bidder.
      For ten years now I have been in charge of these properties. .. I have had
      the interests of thousands of investors in my keeping... and all the while
      I have been like a man surrounded by a pack of wolves. I defended myself
      as I could... in the end, I found that the best way to defend was by
      attacking. In other words, I had to go into politics, to make the control
      of the "Government" a part of my business. Don't you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, I see. But why play such a game?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Why? Because it is the only game I have ever known... the only game
      there is to play. That is the way I have lived my life... the way I have
      risen to power and command. I played it for myself, and for my friends,
      and for those I loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You played it for me! And, oh! father! father!... Can't you see
      what that means to me? To realize that all my life has been based upon
      such things! Don't you see how I can't let it go on... how, if you refuse
      to do what I ask you to, it will be impossible for me to touch a dollar of
      your money?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Just that, father! I should never again be able to face my
      conscience!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [After a pause.] Listen to me, dear. You know that I have always
      meant to withdraw...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I know that. And that has been a confession! You know that you are
      wrecking your life-wrecking everything! And if you mean to stop, why not
      stop?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But, my dear, at this moment... in the midst of the battle. ..
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. At this moment you are on the point of doing something that will
      put a brand upon your conscience for the balance of your career. And at
      this moment you are confronted with the realization that you are ruining
      your daughter's life. You see her before you, desperate... frantic with
      shame and grief. And you have to make up your mind, either to drive her
      from you, heart-broken... or else to turn your face from these evils, and
      to take up a new way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Broken and crushed, sits staring at her.] Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Stretching out her arms to him.] Father! A knock at the door; they
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Enters.] Oh! Beg pardon!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starting up.] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Come in! You must know it!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Shut the door! Grimes, the game is up!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. How d'ye mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. We've been betrayed. Somebody knows all about the Court decision...
      about what passed between you and Porter, and between you and me!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. The hell you say!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. We're threatened with exposure!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Who is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. But, then...
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My daughter tells me. But she is not at liberty to give the names.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Well, I'll be damned! [He stares from HEGAN to LAURA; then comes
      and sits, very deliberately, where he can gaze at them. A long pause;
      then, nodding toward them.] What's her game?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Weakly.] She will tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Looking at her.] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I am here to plead with my father to turn back from this
      wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Stares.] And do what, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Quit Wall Street, and devote himself to some useful work.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [After a pause.] And if he won't?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have told him he must choose between his present career and his
      daughter's love.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Gazes at LAURA, then in front of him; slowly shakes his head.] I
      can't make out our young people. When I was a boy, young women looked up
      to their parents. What's your father done to you, that you should turn
      against him?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have not turned against him, Mr. Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Indicating HEGAN, who sits in an attitude of despair.] Look at
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      [A pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I am pleading with him for his own good... to give up this cruel
      struggle...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. To turn tail and run from his enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is of my duty to the public that I am thinking, Mr. Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. You owe no duty to this world higher than your duty to your
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You think that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I think it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Hesitates a moment, then turns.] Father! What do you say? Is that
      true?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. [Crushed.] I don't know, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. God Almighty! And this is Jim Hegan! [To LAURA.] Where'd you get
      onto these ideas, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [In a low voice.] I think, Mr. Grimes, it might be best if you did
      not ask me to discuss this question. Our points of view are too different.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Shrugs his shoulders.] As you please, ma'am. But you needn't mind
      me... I ain't easy to offend. And I'm only trying to understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [After a silence.] Mr. Grimes, I had the good fortune to be brought
      up in a beautiful and luxurious home; but not long ago I began to go down
      into the slums and see the homes of the people. I saw sights that made me
      sick with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. No doubt, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I found the people in the grip of a predatory organization that had
      bound them hand and foot, and was devouring them alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. You've been listening to tales, ma'am. We do a lot for the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You treat them to free coal and free picnics and free beer, and so
      you get their votes; and then you sell them out to capitalists like my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Humph!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You sell them out to any one, high or low, who will pay for the
      privilege of exploiting them. You sell them to the rum-dealer and the
      dive-keeper and the gambler. You sell them to the white-slave trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. There's no such person, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You offer an insult to my intelligence, Mr. Grimes. I have met with
      him and his work. There was a girl of the slums... her name was Annie
      Rogers. She was a decent girl; and she was lured into a dive and drugged
      and shut up in a brothel, a prisoner. She escaped to the street, pursued,
      and a friend of mine saved her. And, high and low, among the authorities
      of this city, we sought for justice for that girl, and there was no
      justice to be had. Yesterday afternoon I learned that she cut her own
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And that happened, Mr. Grimes! It happened in the City of New York!
      I saw it with my own eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Such things have been, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you permit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You permit them
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I can't attempt to discuss prostitution with a lady. Such things
      existed long before I was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You could use your power to drive the traffic from the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Yes, ma'am; I suppose I could. But if I'd been that sort of a man,
      do you think I'd ever had the power?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. How neatly parried! What sort of a man are you, anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Looks at hey fixedly.] I'll tell you the sort of man I am, ma'am.
      [A pause.] I wasn't brought up in a beautiful, luxurious home. I was
      brought up with five brothers, in two rooms on the top floor of a rear
      tenement on Avenue B; I was a little street "mick," and then I was a prize
      "scrapper," and the leader of a gang. When a policeman chased me upstairs,
      my mother stood at the head and fought him off with a rolling-pin. That
      was the way we stood by our children, ma'am; and we looked to them to
      stand by us. Once, when I was older, my enemies tried to do me... they
      charged me with a murder that I never done, ma'am. But d'ye think my old
      father ever stopped to ask if I done it or not, ma'am? Not much. "Don't
      mention that, Bob, my boy," says he... "it's all part of the fight, an'
      we're wid yer." [A pause.] I looked about me at the world, ma'am, and I
      found it was full of all sorts of pleasant things, that I'd never had, and
      never stood a chance of havin'. They were for the rich... the people on
      top. And they looked on with scorn... I was poor and I was low, and I
      wasn't fit for anything. And so I set to climb, ma'am. I shouldered my way
      up. I met men that fought me; I fought them back, and I won out. That's
      the sort of man I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I see. A selfish man, bent upon power at any price! A brutal man,
      profiting by the weakness of others! An unscrupulous man, trading upon
      fear and greed! A man who has stopped at no evil to gain his purpose!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I am what the game has made me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Not so! Not so! Many another man has been born to a fate like
      yours, and has fought his way up from the pit... to be a tower of strength
      for goodness and service, an honor to his people and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I've not met any such, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; you've not sought for them. You did not need them in your
      business. The men you needed were the thugs and the criminals, who could
      stuff ballot-boxes for you... the dive-keepers and the vice-sellers, who
      would contribute to your campaign funds! And you have dealt with them...
      you have built up the power they gave you into a mighty engine of
      corruption and wrong! And you are master of it... you use it to wring
      tribute from high and low! Selling immunity to dive-keepers and betraying
      helpless young girls! Naming legislators and judges, and receiving bribes
      to corrupt the highest Court in the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Laura...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father, I did not seek this discussion! He challenged me... and he
      shall hear the truth! For all these months the thing that has been driving
      me to desperation has been the knowledge that my father was the business
      associate and ally of a master of infamy like Robert Grimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Thanks, ma'am! And so now he's to break with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      [A knock at the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Enters, centre.] Mr. Hegan, these orders for your brokers must
      be signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I won't sign them!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Never mind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. [Springing to his feet.] Jim Hegan, you're mad! [TO ANDREWS.] Go
      out, will you? [ANDREWS exit.] Hegan, man... surely you don't mean this?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Yes... I'm sick of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. But, man, think of the rest of us!... What are we to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. You can buy just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. But without you? Why, we won't be able to corner Murdock! And if
      he gets out of this hole, it'll be worse than ever! There'll be hell to
      pay!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I don't care.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. But, man, you've pledged yourself! Look at what Harris has
      done!... What excuse will you be able to make to him? And what will you
      tell Henry Stevens?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I'll tell them I've quit.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. But you told them last night you were going in with every dollar
      you could raise! You told Isaacson he could break with Murdock! And now
      you'll tell them you've turned tail and run! Why, Hegan, it's treason!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Listen to me...
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. I don't want to listen to you! Half an hour from now you'll be
      ashamed of yourself... wishing that nobody had heard you! You'll be
      begging me not to mention it! You... Jim Hegan... the traction king! To
      lose your nerve over a little thing like this! What's come over you,
      anyhow... after all the things we've been through together? Why, man...
    </p>
    <p>
      [The 'phone rings.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Hello! Who is it? Oh, Isaacson. Yes; I'll speak with him. Hello,
      Isaacson! Yes. No; I've not forgotten. I'll do whatever I said I'd do.
      Er... yes; that's all right. I've been delayed. Yes. I'll get the money to
      you. Right away. Oh, certainly, that's all right. [Hangs up receiver.] Ah,
      God!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Hegan, listen here. You're in the midst of a battle. And you're
      the general. Everything depends on you this morning. And you've a right to
      be afraid.. but you've no right to let others see it. You've no right...
      do you understand me? And, by God, I won't let you!... I'll be a man for
      two of you! Shake yourself together now! [Seizes him.] Come, man! Shake
      yourself together!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But think of the exposure!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. The exposure! And this is Jim Hegan talking! How many times have
      you been exposed already? And how many times have I been?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But this is different.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. How different? We've got the police, and we've got the district
      attorney, and we've got the courts. What more do we want? What can they do
      but talk in the newspapers? And is there anything they haven't said about
      us already? [Takes HEGAN by the arm, and laughs.] Come, old man! As my
      friend Leary says: "Dis is a nine-day town. If yez kin stand de gaff for
      nine days, ye're all right!" We'll stand the gaff!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I'm tired of standing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Yes, we all get tired now and then. But this afternoon it'll be
      Murdock that's tired. Think of him, Hegan... try to realize him a bit!
      You've got him where you want him at last! Remember what he did to you in
      the Brooklyn Ferry case! Remember how he lied to you in the Third Avenue
      case! And he told Isaacson, only last week, that he'd never let up on you
      till he'd driven you out of the traction field!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Did he say that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. He did that! And only yesterday he said he was getting ready to
      finish you! He's as sure of this Court decision as I am of the sunrise!
      I'm told he's short already over a quarter of a million shares!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. But his judges'll get word to him... he'll buy!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Of course! But that's just why you ought to be busy! Buy first,
      and make him pay... damn his soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANDREWS. [Knocks and enters.] Mr. Stevens is here, Mr. Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Henry Stevens? We'll see him. [ANDREWS exit.] Come on, man! We'll
      go over to your brokers and take the orders. It'll give you a smell of the
      powder smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [AS HEGAN Starts to follow.] Father, you are going with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear child, what can I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But think of the disgrace... the shame of it! You will carry it
      with you all your life!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. I can't help it. I am bound hand and foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father! [She rushes to him, and flings her arms about him.] Do you
      realize what you are doing? You are driving me away from you!.. . You are
      casting me off! And all for a few more dollars!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. My dear, it is not that. My word is pledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You are trampling me in the dust. You are spurning all that is best
      in your life!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRIMES. Come, come, man! The game is called
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. Let me go, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEGAN. No! No! [He gently, but firmly, puts her arms from him.] Good-bye,
      dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Father! [HEGAN and GRIMES go out centre; she sinks by the table,
      and buries her face in her arms, sobbing; after a considerable, interval,
      a knock on the door, centre.] Come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Enters.] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have failed. [Rises and stretches out her arms.] Failed! He has
      gone with Grimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I saw him go, Miss Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Swiftly.] And yet... I have not failed utterly. I have failed to
      turn back the decision... to save him from this disgrace. But that is not
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE: How do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I shall not give him up... and, in the end, I shall have my way; I
      can see that quite clearly. Ah, how I hurt him! I almost broke his heart!
      And just now he is in the midst of the battle... the rage of it is on him.
      But, afterwards, he will recollect... he will be overwhelmed with grief!
      And then he will see! He will do what I have begged him to!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes... perhaps that is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I know what my love means to him! I know what he is at heart! And
      when he sees that I mean to carry out my threat, to go by myself and to
      refuse to touch his money... that will be more than he can bear, Mr.
      Montague!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. You mean to do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I mean to do it! I mean to do it today; and I will never yield to
      him... never until he has atoned for this wrong he has done! And don't you
      see that I will win in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Yes; I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Quickly.] Understand, that has nothing to do with your course. I
      am not asking you to spare him. You must go ahead and do your duty... you
      must do just what you would have done if I had never stood in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. It is a terrible thing to me, Miss Hegan. I cannot turn back...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You must not! You must not think of it! It will be a part of my
      father's punishment... and he has deserved it. He has prepared that cup,
      and he must drink it... to the dregs!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. You can bear it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is not any question of what I can bear. It is a question of the
      rights of the people. I saw that quite clearly, as my father talked with
      me. Whether it is he who wins, or whether it is Murdock, it is always the
      people that lose. And, let it hurt whom it may, the people must have the
      truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. And then... you will be able to forgive me! Ah, what a weight
      you lift from me! I hardly dared to face the thought of what I had to do!
      [Hesitating.] And then, the thought that you mean to renounce your
      father's wealth... that you are going out into the world... alone...
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It will not be hard for me. You cannot know how I have hated my
      past life. To know that my father has plundered the public... and then to
      give his money, and call it charity. To be flattered and fawned upon... to
      be celebrated and admired... and never for anything that I am, but always
      for my money!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I understand what you feel! And see what your decision means to
      me... it sets me free at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Free!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Free to speak! Miss Hegan, I came to New York, and I met these
      rich people, and I saw how their fortunes were poisoning their lives. I
      saw men who could not have a real friend in the world, because of their
      money. I saw young girls whose souls were utterly dead in them because
      they had been brought up to think of themselves as keepers of money-bags,
      and to guard against men who sought to prey upon them. I hated the
      thing... I fled from it as I would from a plague. In that world I had met
      a woman I might have loved... a woman who was noble and beautiful and
      true; and yet I dared not speak to her... I dared not even permit myself
      to know her... because I was a poor man, and she was rich. But now she is
      to be poor also! And so I may speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Starting.] Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. Miss Hegan, from the first time I met you I felt that you were
      the woman I should love. But then, as fate would have it, I found myself
      preparing to attack your father; so I said that we must never meet again.
      But now you see how it has happened. I have come to know you as I never
      hoped to know you, and I know that I love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I had no idea...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. You say that you are going away alone. Let us go together. We
      have the same purpose... we have the same battle to fight. We can go out
      to the people and help to teach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You... you know that you love me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. I love you! I want nothing so much as the chance to serve you
      and help you. The chance to tell you so is more than I had ever ventured
      to hope for. To find you free and alone... to be able to speak to you,
      with no thought of wealth or position! To tell you that I love you... just
      you! You!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I hardly dare to think of it... now... here...
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. We can put all the past behind us... we can take a new start and
      win our own way. If only you love me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Ah, to let myself be happy again. How can I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. If you love me, then we have the key to happiness... then
      everything is clear before us. We can face the world together! Do you love
      me? [Stretches out his arms to her.] Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. [Sways toward him.] I love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTAGUE. [Embraces her.] My love!
    </p>
    <p>
      CURTAIN <br /><br />

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
